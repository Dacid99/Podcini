# PodVinci

PodVinci is an open source podcast manager/player project.

This is based on a fork from the popular project AntennaPod (https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod) as of Feb 5 2024. 

This project converted all codes from Java to Kotlin, updated most dependencies, and most importantly upgraded the media player to androidx.media3, and added mechanism of AudioOffloadMode which is supposed to be kind to device battery.  Build is also upgraded to target Android 14.
